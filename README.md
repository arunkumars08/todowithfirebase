# todowithfirebase

Open your git bash,

type git clone https://github.com/arunkumars08/todowithfirebase.git

navigate into the todowithfirebase folder

Run npm install

After the modules are installed

Run npm start, The server starts up in port:8080 usually

Hit http://localhost:8080 in the browser, the you can see the web application up and running.

But things still won't work fine.

You have to create an account in firebase.google.com for getting API credentials and other bunch of stuffs.

Once you have made changes in the app/js/script.js file where I have commented out what has to be done with the API, things should work fine.
